Sissie's Project Hub

A modern web-based personal project aggregator designed to showcase my expertise and exploration in Computer Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Embedded Systems, and Digital Arts.

🌟 Project Highlights

Dynamic Visual Interaction: High-performance particle flow background developed using native Canvas API, creating a sophisticated tech-focused atmosphere.

Hybrid Presentation Modes:

Interactive Demos: Core projects support direct navigation to live demonstration pages (e.g., AI Cargo Scanning, GPA Calculator).

In-depth Technical Elaboration: For non-web projects (e.g., Embedded Hardware, CAD Automation), detailed technical breakdowns are provided via custom-built modals.

Professional Glassmorphism Design: Sleek, modern UI utilizing translucent layers and Lucide icons, fully optimized for responsive viewing across all devices.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Front-end Core: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+)

Graphics: HTML5 Canvas 2D Context (for particle dynamics simulation)

Iconography: Lucide Icons

Design Patterns: Responsive layout, dynamic modal logic, CSS variable management.

📁 Core Modules

AI Cargo Scanning System (Demo)

Link: countingEN.html

Function: Demonstrates real-time cargo classification using OpenCV and AI APIs.

Final Grade Calculator (Demo)

Link: GPACalculator.html

Function: An interactive academic management tool for GPA target planning.

Technical Elaboration Modals

Provides deep-dives for Hospital Monitor (Arduino/C++) and 2D Platformer (Unity/C#), allowing recruiters to quickly assess implementation logic.
